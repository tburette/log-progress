log-progress
============

* What tasks do I really spend time on?
* How much time is actual coding-related time?
* How much time do I spend looking up documentation?
* How much am I interrupted by the phone/mails/colleagues/?

Get insight of how you actually work. Simply type what you are doing and it is saved in a file along with the time.

Review the file later to analyse how long you spend on each time. It is admittedly rather cumbersome to log each and every task you perform but the insight you gain is fairly useful. The more detail you type the more detailed your analysis is.

You'll be surprised at the results.
